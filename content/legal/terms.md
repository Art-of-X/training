# Terms of Service for art ×

**Last Updated: [Date]**

Welcome to art ×! We're excited to have you join our experimental platform for creativity and artificial intelligence. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our platform, so please read them carefully. By creating an account or using our services, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. About Us & Our Platform

We are **art × - Art of X UG (haftungsbeschränkt)**, located at Goethestr. 59, 10625 Berlin, Germany.

Our platform is a space for creatives like you to contribute data (like voice recordings, texts, images, or other materials) that we use to train artificial intelligence models. We're currently in an early, experimental "pre-seed" phase. This means our services are constantly evolving, and things might change, break, or look different over time.

## 2. Your Account

To use most features, you'll need to create an account. You are responsible for keeping your account details safe. You must be at least 18 years old to use the platform.

## 3. The Data You Provide ("User Content")

You own the creative content you provide to the platform. We don't claim any ownership of your original materials.

By uploading or providing content, you grant us a license to use it for the purposes outlined below. This license is a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, process, and distribute your User Content through our platform.

## 4. How We Use Your Data & AI Models

Your data is essential for building our AI models. Here's how we use it:

### a. Your Personal AI Model

A portion of our service is dedicated to creating a personalized AI model trained exclusively on your User Content. We aim to provide you with access to this personal model. While access is currently free, we may introduce a fee for creating or accessing your personal model in the future. We will notify you well in advance of any such changes.

### b. Our General AI Models & Datasets

We are also building larger, more general AI models by combining data from multiple users. You have the option to allow your User Content to be included in these general models. These models are part of our core product, which we may offer to clients or use for commercial purposes.

By contributing to our general models, you are helping to build a unique, proprietary dataset. We believe in rewarding our contributors, and while we are still developing the specifics, we plan to create models for fairly compensating users who participate in building our commercial offerings.

## 5. Your Right to Data Deletion

**This is important:** You are in control of your data.

You can request the deletion of your account and all associated User Content at any time. When you make a deletion request, we will permanently remove your data from our active systems and databases.

Crucially, after you request deletion, we will no longer use your data to train any new models, and we will take all reasonable steps to remove your data from our existing models where technically feasible. We will not retain any rights to your data after you have asked for it to be deleted.

To request data deletion, please contact us at [hello@art-of-x.com](mailto:hello@art-of-x.com).

## 6. Platform Use & Restrictions

Our platform is currently free to use for invited participants. We reserve the right to introduce fees for certain features in the future. You agree not to misuse the service, for example, by uploading illegal content, infringing on others' intellectual property, or trying to disrupt our systems.

## 7. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability

As our platform is in an experimental phase, it is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties of any kind. We cannot guarantee that it will always be perfect, secure, or available.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, art × shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses.

## 8. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time as our platform evolves. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the platform or by email. Your continued use of the platform after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

## 9. Governing Law & Jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. The place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with these Terms shall be Berlin, Germany.

## 10. Contact Us

If you have any questions about these Terms, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at **hello@art-of-x.com**.
