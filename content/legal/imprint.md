## Out-of-court dispute resolution
The EU Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR platform) for consumer disputes arising from online sales contracts and online service contracts. You can access this platform on the Internet at: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.

We are not willing or obliged to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board. Instead, we are keen to resolve disputes with our customers through direct contact. Please contact customer service. We can be contacted at the following e-mail address: hello@art-of-x.com

As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 (1) TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general laws.
