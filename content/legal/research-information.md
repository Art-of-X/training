## Study Overview: Modeling Artistic Cognition

### Research Question
*Toward Creative Reasoning in Language Models*

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled machines to generate increasingly sophisticated text. However, these models often fall short when tasked with producing truly creative work—outputs that demonstrate originality, imagination, and artistic depth. This study explores whether creativity in LLMs can be enhanced through fine-tuning based on unique training data derived from interactions with professional artists. 

Specifically, we ask: **Does a LLM model fine-tuned through dedicated training situations with artists perform better in creativity assessments than a baseline foundation model?**

### Research Method

To investigate this, we conduct a novel experiment involving 25 young artists from diverse disciplines (painting, performance, design…). Each artist engages in four distinct training scenarios:

- Open discussion
- Monologue-style narration  
- Coaching-style feedback
- Free creative exploration

These sessions generate a rich corpus of artistic thinking and reasoning. We then will extract question–answer pairs and perform cognitive pattern analysis to identify stylistic and conceptual markers of artistic thinking, which will be used to fine-tune the base LLM.

### Evaluation Method

The performance of the fine-tuned model will be evaluated using a combination of subjective human assessments and standardized creativity tests. In total, 100 independent raters will score outputs from both the fine-tuned and baseline models using a validated creativity rubric. Additionally, the models will be subjected to agentic creativity evaluations, including the Alternative Uses Task and the Remote Associates Test.

### Research Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that the fine-tuned model—trained via direct, structured engagement with artists—will produce outputs rated as more creative than those of the untuned baseline. By embedding artistic cognition into the training loop, we aim to explore new territory in human–AI co-creation and push the boundaries of computational creativity.
